Improving a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) can involve several strategies, ranging from architectural changes to tweaking training dynamics. Here are some suggestions to enhance the performance of your GAN:

1. **Use a More Complex Model Architecture**:
   - Consider using deeper or more complex architectures for both the generator and discriminator. This can include adding more layers or using advanced architectures like ResNet or U-Net for the generator.

2. **Use Batch Normalization**:
   - Integrate batch normalization layers in both the generator and discriminator. Batch normalization can help stabilize training by normalizing the input to each layer.

3. **Advanced Activation Functions**:
   - Experiment with different activation functions like SELU or ELU, which might offer better performance than traditional ReLU or LeakyReLU.

4. **Different Loss Functions**:
   - Explore alternative loss functions. For instance, the Wasserstein loss with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) can provide more stable and reliable training of GANs.

5. **Label Smoothing**:
   - For the discriminator, use label smoothing, i.e., use soft labels (like 0.9 or 0.1 instead of 1 or 0) to prevent the discriminator from becoming too confident, which can lead to overfitting.

6. **Add Noise to Labels**:
   - Inject noise into discriminator labels as a form of regularization, which can prevent the discriminator from overpowering the generator.

7. **Learning Rate Scheduling**:
   - Implement a learning rate scheduler to adjust the learning rates during training. This can help in fine-tuning the model as training progresses.

8. **Feature Matching**:
   - Use feature matching techniques to force the generator to reproduce certain features of the real images, enhancing the quality of the generated images.

9. **Training Tricks**:
   - Alternate between more than one discriminator update per generator update.
   - Use a buffer of previously generated images and train the discriminator on both fresh and old generated images.

10. **Monitoring and Tuning**:
    - Monitor the training process closely using TensorBoard or similar tools. Sometimes, subtle changes in loss curves can indicate whether the model is learning effectively.
    - Fine-tune hyperparameters such as the learning rate, batch size, or architecture based on the monitoring feedback.

11. **Data Augmentation**:
    - Apply data augmentation techniques to the training dataset to increase the diversity of the training data, which can make the model more robust.

12. **GANs with Attention Mechanisms**:
    - Integrate attention mechanisms into your GAN architecture, which can help the model focus on more relevant parts of the image.

13. **Experiment with Different Datasets**:
    - Sometimes, the choice of dataset can significantly impact the performance of a GAN. Experimenting with different datasets or variations of your current dataset might yield better results.

Remember, GANs are notoriously difficult to train, and there's often a delicate balance between the generator and discriminator. It's essential to experiment and iteratively refine your approach. Also, keep in mind that more complex models require more computational resources and may have longer training times.
